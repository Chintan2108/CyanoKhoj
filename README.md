## Summary

CyanoKhoj is a web-app which employs the citizen science program by tracking their tweets and subsequent data analysis on Google Earth Engine, aimed at effective CyanoHAB detection and monitoring in water bodies around the world. The objective is to identify potential CyanoHAB infested locations based on Twitter data analysis and location extraction and further analyze these locations using satellite data in Google Earth Engine.

### Tweet Analysis and Location Extraction

This is done by scraping tweets real-time feed and filtering them based on the project specific keywords and hashtags (using NLP techniques) which help in identifying tweets about algal bloom infested waterbodies. Thereafter the location tags are extracted from the filtered tweets and are geocoded. These locations are sent to Google Map and Google Earth Engine and a map highlighting the potential cyanobloom locations.

The following repositories contain detailed workflow and information the tweet analysis and location extraction task:
* [Location Fetcher v1.8](https://github.com/Chintan2108/LocationFetcher-v1.8)
* [Location Fetcher v2.1](https://github.com/Chintan2108/LocationFetcher-v2.1)

**Inference :** The tweets are first preprocessed by tokenizing, removing stop words, hastags, user names etc and embedded to vectors using the **glove twitter-25** embedding. Four similarities - Cosine, Soft Cosine, WMD (Word Mover Distance ) and WMD Relax are calculated between the tweets and the [query](https://github.com/Chintan2108/CyanoKhoj/blob/9d134b73a8458b3d0c41a51cac5d0c80cc52f4be/tweet_tracker.py#L30) containing the filter keywords. As it could be seen the similarity increases between the [query](https://github.com/Chintan2108/CyanoKhoj/blob/9d134b73a8458b3d0c41a51cac5d0c80cc52f4be/tweet_tracker.py#L30) and the tweets in case of WMD and WMD-Relax in comparison to the cosine and soft similarity metrics. 


### Geospatial Analysis on Google Earth Engine

The suspected locations are then analyzed using the Sentinel-3 satellite data to determine whether the flagged waterbodies are suffering from an algal bloom. Various image processing techniques and indices are implemented to quantify the data indications in each pixel of the image.

### Deoplyment

This webapp has been deployed on GCP in the Apache server. Technicalities include in-house python function calls from PHP core environment, managing API requests and maintaining the deployment with timely feature updates.
